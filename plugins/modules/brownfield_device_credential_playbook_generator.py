"""
Ansible module for brownfield YAML playbook generation of device credentials.

This module automates the extraction of device credential configurations from Cisco
Catalyst Center infrastructure, transforming them into YAML playbooks compatible
with device_credential_workflow_manager module. It retrieves global device
credentials (CLI, HTTPS Read/Write, SNMPv2c Read/Write, SNMPv3) and site-specific
credential assignments via REST APIs, applies optional component-based filters for
targeted extraction, masks sensitive fields with Jinja2 variable placeholders, and
generates formatted YAML files for configuration documentation, credential auditing,
disaster recovery, and multi-site credential standardization workflows.

description:
- Automates brownfield YAML playbook generation for device credential
  configurations deployed in Cisco Catalyst Center infrastructure.
- Extracts global device credentials (CLI, HTTPS Read/Write, SNMPv2c Read/Write,
  SNMPv3) and site-specific credential assignments via REST APIs.
- Generates YAML files compatible with device_credential_workflow_manager module
  for configuration documentation, credential auditing, disaster recovery, and
  multi-site credential standardization.
- Supports auto-discovery mode for complete credential infrastructure extraction
  or component-based filtering for targeted extraction (global credentials,
  site assignments).
- Masks sensitive fields (passwords, community strings, auth credentials) with
  Jinja2 variable placeholders for secure playbook generation.
- Transforms camelCase API responses to snake_case YAML format with comprehensive
  header comments and metadata.

notes:
  - SDK methods utilized - discovery.get_all_global_credentials,
    site_design.get_sites, network_settings.get_device_credential_settings_for_a_site
  - API paths utilized - GET /dna/intent/api/v2/global-credential,
    GET /dna/intent/api/v1/sites, GET /dna/intent/api/v1/sites/${id}/deviceCredentials
  - Module is idempotent; multiple runs generate identical YAML content except
    timestamp in header comments.
  - Check mode supported; validates parameters without file generation.
  - Sensitive credential fields (passwords, community strings, auth credentials)
    masked with Jinja2 variable placeholders (e.g., {{ cli_credential_wlc_password }}).
  - Generated YAML uses OrderedDumper for consistent key ordering enabling version
    control.
  - Description-based filtering is case-sensitive and requires exact matches.
  - Site hierarchical paths must match exact Catalyst Center site structure.

class DeviceCredentialPlaybookGenerator(DnacBase, BrownFieldHelper):
    """
    Brownfield playbook generator for Cisco Catalyst Center device credentials.

    This class orchestrates automated YAML playbook generation for device credential
    configurations by extracting existing settings from Cisco Catalyst Center via
    REST APIs and transforming them into Ansible playbooks compatible with the
    device_credential_workflow_manager module.

    The generator supports both auto-discovery mode (extracting all configured
    credentials and site assignments) and targeted extraction mode (filtering by
    credential types and site names) to facilitate brownfield infrastructure
    documentation, configuration backup, migration planning, and multi-site
    deployment standardization workflows.

    Key Capabilities:
    - Extracts six credential types (CLI, HTTPS Read/Write, SNMPv2c Read/Write,
      SNMPv3) with description-based filtering from global credential store
    - Retrieves site credential assignments mapping credentials to site hierarchies
      for multi-site deployment documentation
    - Masks sensitive credential fields (passwords, community strings, auth passwords)
      with Jinja variable placeholders to prevent raw credential exposure in YAML
    - Generates YAML files with comprehensive header comments including metadata,
      generation timestamp, configuration summary statistics, and usage instructions
    - Supports legacy filter formats (global_filters) and modern nested filter
      structures (component_specific_filters) for backward compatibility
    - Transforms camelCase API response keys to snake_case YAML format for improved
      playbook readability and maintainability

    Inheritance:
        DnacBase: Provides Cisco Catalyst Center API connectivity, authentication,
                  request execution, logging infrastructure, and common utility methods
        BrownFieldHelper: Provides parameter transformation utilities, reverse mapping
                         functions, and configuration processing helpers for brownfield
                         operations including modify_parameters() and YAML generation

    Class-Level Attributes:
        supported_states (list): List of supported Ansible states, currently
                                ['gathered'] for configuration extraction workflow
        module_schema (dict): Network elements schema configuration mapping API
                             families, functions, filters, and reverse mapping
                             specifications for credential components
        site_id_name_dict (dict): Cached mapping of site UUIDs to hierarchical site
                                 names from Catalyst Center for site name resolution
        global_credential_details (dict): Cached global credentials grouped by type
                                         (cliCredential, httpsRead, etc.) from
                                         discovery.get_all_global_credentials API
        module_name (str): Target workflow manager module name for generated playbooks
                          ('device_credential_workflow_manager')
        values_to_nullify (list): List of string values to treat as None during
                                 processing (e.g., ['NOT CONFIGURED'])


    Workflow Execution:
        1. validate_input() - Validates playbook configuration parameters and filters
        2. get_want() - Constructs desired state parameters from validated configuration
        3. get_diff_gathered() - Orchestrates YAML generation workflow execution
        4. yaml_config_generator() - Generates YAML file with header and configurations
        5. get_global_credential_details_configuration() - Retrieves global credentials
        6. get_assign_credentials_to_site_configuration() - Retrieves site assignments
        7. filter_credentials() - Applies description-based credential filtering
        8. write_dict_to_yaml() - Writes formatted YAML with header comments to file

    Error Handling:
        - Comprehensive parameter validation with detailed error messages
        - API exception handling with error tracking and logging
        - File I/O error handling with fallback messaging and status reporting
        - Component-specific filter validation preventing invalid configurations
        - Credential ID matching validation with warnings for missing credentials

    Version Requirements:
        - Cisco Catalyst Center: 2.3.7.9 or higher
        - dnacentersdk: 2.10.10 or higher
        - Python: 3.9 or higher
        - PyYAML: 5.1 or higher (for YAML serialization with OrderedDumper)

    Notes:
        - The class is idempotent; multiple runs with same parameters generate
          identical YAML content (except generation timestamp in header comments)
        - Check mode is supported but does not perform actual file generation;
          validates parameters and returns expected operation results
        - Large-scale deployments with many credentials and sites may require
          increased dnac_api_task_timeout values for complete data extraction
        - Generated YAML files use OrderedDumper for consistent key ordering across
          multiple generations enabling reliable version control
        - Credential description fields are case-sensitive and must match exact
          descriptions configured in Catalyst Center
        - Site names must be full hierarchical paths (e.g., 'Global/India/Assam')
          and are case-sensitive matching exact site hierarchy

    Main entry point for Ansible module execution.
    This function orchestrates complete brownfield YAML playbook generation
    workflow by parsing Ansible module parameters with connection credentials
    and configuration filters, initializing DeviceCredentialPlaybookGenerator
    instance for Catalyst Center API interaction, validating minimum Catalyst
    Center version requirement (2.3.7.9+) for brownfield generation support,
    checking requested state against supported states (gathered only), validating
    input configuration parameters against schema with required field checking,
    iterating through validated configurations to execute get_want() for
    parameter preparation and get_diff_gathered() for YAML generation workflow,
    and returning operation results via module.exit_json() with success/failure
    status, generated file path, and component processing summary for Ansible
    playbook feedback.

    The function handles complete module lifecycle including parameter
    specification, version compatibility checking, state validation, input
    validation, workflow execution, and result aggregation for brownfield
    device credential YAML playbook generation.

    Args:
        None: Reads parameters from Ansible runtime environment via AnsibleModule
            argument parsing with element_spec definition.

    Returns:
        None: Exits via module.exit_json() with operation results including:
            - changed: Boolean indicating configuration changes (always False

    Raises:
        Exits via check_return_status() when:
        - Catalyst Center version below 2.3.7.9 minimum requirement
        - Invalid state provided (not 'gathered')
        - Input validation fails with schema violations
        - YAML generation workflow encounters errors
        - API calls fail during credential retrieval
